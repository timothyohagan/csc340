In order to write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adptable it is best to follow all industry standards.  This makes it very clear for you and others to continue working on the program after its initial development.  

As a computer scientist, I have to approach problems in a logical and systematic way, just like a computer executes the commands.  Most computer science problems are very complex with many different compnents working together.  It's always best to solve a complex problem, by first solving a simplier problem.  Break the problem down and solve it one small part at a time.

Computer scientist look at problems and create solutions.  We look at what ultimatly needs to be acomplished, and we apply alogorithms to do what needs to be acomplished in a way that is automated and easier than a human performing each step individually by themselves.
